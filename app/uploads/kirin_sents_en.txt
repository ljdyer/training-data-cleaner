It inhabits the grasslands that have grown with the Acacia genus, the genus COMMIPHORA, the genus COMBRETUM, and the forests consisting of the genus Terminalia.
He lives in a flock of about 10-20, with a loose connection that fluctuates the composition and population.
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, there are cases of 20-30 flocks, but in the 2000s, there have been reports that average is 6 or less.
In the 800 -day observation at Serengetti National Park, there are cases where only two cases had not changed for more than 24 hours.
The scalpel has about 120 square kilometers, and the male range is smaller, but it is wider if it is a young beast male living alone without being included in the flock.
It is thought that the range mainly active within the action sphere is limited to the center, and there is a buffer zone in the outer circle.
If the action sphere overlaps with other individuals, they form a flock with those individuals.
It mainly eats at the time of lightly dusk, and ruminates during the day.
Normally, rest and sleep while standing upright, but if safety is secured, you may sit for a few hours and rest.
Bend the forelimbs and one hind limb inside and sit on the ground.
There are various theories about the day of sleep, but it is 3-4 minutes a day to take a deeper sleeping posture, at the longest for 10 minutes.
Unlike other herbivores living in Africa, it can live without drinking water only from the water from the leaves of the food, so it does not move even in the dry season.
You can run at 50-60 km / h.
Although it rarely screams, it can make various voices, such as groaning and sounding.
The food is a plant diet, and it mainly eats wooden leaves, young buds, and twigs, such as the genus acacia, but may also eat fruits and grass books.
Foods with spines such as acacia are formed with tongue and lips, so that the mouth is covered with sticky saliva, then crushed and swallowed with a groove.
Males are eating a higher place in a higher place with the neck stretched, and the female eats low and shrub leaves at the height of the shoulders in a twisted posture of the neck.
Unlike the grass plants, the ripples of the Takagi are not so low in quality and do not have much food restrictions in the dry season, so during the dry season, you can eat the leaves around the water area and grow them without large -scale movement.
If the food is fresh, you can survive for a few months without drinking water.
When drinking water or shrub leaves, or when you eat the fruits that have fallen to the ground, spread your forelimbs to the left and right, and drink water while standing.
This is probably because it can escape immediately when an enemy is attacked.
The predators of young beasts are mainly lions, but they are also preyed by hyenas, leopards and rikaon within three months after birth.
When a young beast is attacked, the mother fights by kicking.
This kick may kill the lion.
Males determine their superiority by comparing the back, but many male male male who has not been particularly defined because male strikes each other and fights in a ritual (necking).
The dominant male patrols within the action area, and other males will show off their superiors in their backs, while mating if there is an estrus female.
The pregnancy period is 453-464 days.
The birth interval is 20 months on average.
At the time of childbirth, the young beast will fall from the height of 2 meters, but the long body will be reduced to the impact of falling.
The nursing period is 10 months.
In two weeks after birth, you will eat vegetables.
The mortality rate within three months of birth is 50 %in Serengetti National Park.
The mortality rate within one year of birth is 58 %in Serengetti National Park.
Nairobi National Park is 73 %.
There is a tendency to form a flock between young beasts, and the females join the flocks born as they are after the lactation period, and the male forms a flock only by young beasts, and moves from the action sphere that grew up and raised in 3-4 years after birth.do.
Males mature 42 months after birth, but they will participate in breeding after eight years.
Life is 25 years.
Kirin sometimes eats small animals such as birds.
According to "Kirin I'm sorry, Kirin", Kirin at Tama Zoological Park eats tonkatsu and pigeons, so when I switched to high protein feed, I rarely eat meat.
The book contains a photo with a pigeon that was a hot topic at the time, and a photo of stretching the tongue behind the pigeon.
